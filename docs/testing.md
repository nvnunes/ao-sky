# Testing

This document is the source of truth for local verification commands and
completion expectations in `ao-sky`.

## Shared Validation

Use the shared base testing guidance in `astro-agents/validation/base-testing.md`.

## Environment

Use the local `./.conda` environment for Python commands, test runs, packaging
checks, and docs builds unless a task explicitly requires something else.

Create the environment and install the package with:

```bash
conda create -y -p ./.conda python=3.12
./.conda/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
```

## Canonical Verification Commands

Run the Python test suite with:

```bash
./.conda/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Build the package artifacts with:

```bash
./.conda/bin/python -m build --no-isolation
```

Build the docs site in strict mode with:

```bash
./.conda/bin/mkdocs build --strict
```

Smoke-check the installed CLI entrypoint with:

```bash
./.conda/bin/ao-sky --version
```

Refresh the editable install whenever package metadata, dependencies, or entry
points change:

```bash
./.conda/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
```

## Completion Expectations

Run the full package-surface verification path before concluding substantial
changes to the public package surface:

- `./.conda/bin/python -m pytest -q`
- `./.conda/bin/python -m build --no-isolation`
- `./.conda/bin/mkdocs build --strict`
- `./.conda/bin/ao-sky --version`

Docs-only work is complete when:

- the changed docs remain internally consistent
- source-of-truth ownership remains clear across `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
  the docs surface
- cross-links and package/workflow claims remain current
- the strict docs build passes

Package, CLI, or packaging changes are complete when:

- the package installs cleanly in editable mode
- the Python test suite passes
- the package build succeeds
- the CLI smoke check succeeds
- docs are updated when supported usage or workflow changed

Planning, architecture, or benchmark-sensitive doc changes are complete when:

- the owning document reflects the decision
- adjacent docs are updated when discovery or ownership changes
- benchmark-sensitive claims remain consistent with `docs/benchmarking.md`

## Verification Scope Boundaries

- Keep environment creation, activation, and daily workflow commands in
  `docs/development.md`.
- Keep verification commands and completion expectations here.
- Keep benchmark methodology and benchmark results in `docs/benchmarking.md`.
